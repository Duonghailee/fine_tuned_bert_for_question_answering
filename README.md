# fine_tuned_bert_for_question_answering
This is the repo for fine tuning a bert based model for downstream task: question answering.
The whole notebook codes are referenced from Hugginface published notebook on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/master/examples/question_answering.ipynb#scrollTo=-t1DxGvTuGFp) , with slightly modifications for research's experiment purpose only. We keep the valuation part form the original notebook untoched and use it to evaluate our fine-tuned models. Other parts have been slightly modified 

Thanks for Huggingface team.
